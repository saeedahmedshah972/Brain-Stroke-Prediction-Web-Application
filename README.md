# Brain-Stroke-Prediction-Web-Application
# 🧠 Brain Stroke Prediction Web App

This is a simple and interactive web application built using **Streamlit** that predicts whether a brain scan image shows signs of a **stroke** or is **normal**.

Users can upload a brain CT or MRI image, and the app uses a trained **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** model to analyze the image and make predictions in real time.

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- Python
- Streamlit
- TensorFlow / Keras
- OpenCV / PIL
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

## 💡 Features
- Upload a brain scan image (JPEG/PNG)
- Predicts if the brain shows signs of a stroke
- Fast and user-friendly interface
- Deep learning-based backend model

## 🏁 How to Run the App
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
streamlit run app.py
